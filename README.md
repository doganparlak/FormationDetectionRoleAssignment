## Formation Detection and Role Assignment Algorithm

The Formation Detection and Role Assignment  project aims to detect the shape of a team at any given frame (snapshot) during a match and assign roles to players using computational geometry and network science techniques. The data used to develop this project was provided by UEFA and FIFA, including tracking and event data. However, due to confidentiality reasons, this data cannot be shared.

### Folder Overview:

- **Figures**: This folder includes the output of the analysis conducted for the Italy vs Spain and Germany vs Hungary matches from EURO 2020. It contains visualizations and figures depicting the detected formations and player roles. Additionally, a template showing the color assignment for horizontal roles is included in the folder to aid in the analysis and visualization of player roles.

### Project Files:

- **formation_detection_role_assignment.ipynb**: This Jupyter Notebook contains the source code created for the purpose of this analysis. It includes code for detecting team formations, assigning player roles, and generating visualizations based on computational geometry and network science techniques.
